# Smart wardrobe
An app that scans and tracks the clothes in the wardrobe to reduce the fast fashion problem. The ultimate goal will be to provide an ever-present proposal to be able to reuse the same garments without continually buying new ones. The App will track the use and age of the garments for responsible use and aimed at containing waste but at the same time at user satisfaction.

The initial step will be the creation of the template and the analysis of the user experience, the next step will be:

1 - Creation of the REST API environment for Login, upload and clothes management\n
2 -Give users the ability to share your outfit ideas
3 -Connect the app to the main used markets
4 - AI that tracks and suggests to users the garments that are not used frequently
5- Improved AI to suggest outfits in correlation to the weather and user's mood
